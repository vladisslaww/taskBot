# Task bot for Trello

This bot allows to add task/cards to your Trello board via Telegram.
You can try it in Telegram -- @Send_tasks_bot

If you want to get it up and running, you will need to fill .env file:

```
TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=
TRELLO_KEY=
TRELLO_SECRET=
TRELLO_TOKEN=

```

### Though I can't imagine the situation where you will need it on your local machine
